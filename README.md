## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```shell
composer require sayeed/custom-migrate
```

### Laravel 5.5 and above

The package will automatically register itself, so you can start using it immediately.

### Laravel 5.4 and older

In Laravel version 5.4 and older, you have to add the service provider in `config/app.php` file manually:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Sayeed\CustomMigrate\CustomMigrateServiceProvider::class,
];
```
### Lumen

After installing the package, you will have to register it in `bootstrap/app.php` file manually:
```php
// Register Service Providers
    // ...
    $app->register(Sayeed\CustomMigrate\CustomMigrateServiceProvider::class);
];
```

## Usage

After installing the package, you will now see a new ```php artisan migrate:custom``` command.

### Migrate specific file

You can migrate a specific file inside your `database/migrations` folder using:

```php artisan migrate:custom -f 2018_10_14_054732_create_tests_table```

Alternatively, you can use the longform version:

```php artisan migrate:custom --file 2018_10_14_054732_create_tests_table```

### Migrate specific directory

You can migrate a specific directory inside your `database/migrations` folder using:

```php artisan migrate:custom -d migrations-subfolder```

Alternatively, you can use the longform version:

```php artisan migrate:custom --directory migrations-subfolder```

### Refreshing migrations

You can refresh migrations inside your project using:

```php artisan migrate:custom -r```

Alternatively, you can use the longform version:
